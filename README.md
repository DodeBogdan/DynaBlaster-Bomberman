# Dyna Blaster - Bomberman

- This project is an implementation of Dyna Blaster in C++.
- It was a teamwork project that I worked with my colleagues from university <a href="https://github.com/gabrielaburtan"> Gabriela Burtan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/robert-adrian99"> Bucur Robert </a> and <a href="https://github.com/DanielaBoncu"> Daniela Boncu</a>.
- This project was realised as part of our laboratories for Standard to Modern C++.
- It has mostly modern C++ code, some UnitTests, a dll and it uses an external library, SFML for graphics and music.
- The file <a href="DynaBlasterDemo.mp4"> DynaBlasterDemo.mp4 </a> is a video presentation of the app in Romanian. In this video are presented the GUI and the implementation of the app.
